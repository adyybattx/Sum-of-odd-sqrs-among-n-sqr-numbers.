## My Solutions to Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website featuring problems that beautifully combine $$\color{yellow}{\text{math}}$$ and $$\color{green}{\text{coding}}$$.

Users have complete freedom to solve these problems using any methods they desire.

The use of $$\color{red}{\text{computer programming}}$$ and related skills is highly recommended.<br>
Here are some of the solutions I really enjoyed creating — my implementations for a variety of interesting problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

**Happy Hunting!**
